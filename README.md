The CMIP5 (CMIP Phase 5) experiment design has been finalized with the following suites of experiments:

    . Decadal Hindcasts and Predictions simulations,
    . Long-term simulations,
    . Atmosphere-only (prescribed SST) simulations for especially computationally-demanding models.


http://dx.doi.org/10.1594/WDCC/CMIP5.BCBMhi contains a searchable table with the DOIs for all datasets that provide them.Dataset DOIs provide  information at the dataset level.
